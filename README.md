**TECHNOLOGIES**
1. carclass_working this one uses python to instantiate various vehicles. It also uses also inheritance and polymorphism. I included the *args used in python for method overloading because we were passing many arguments in the code.
2. datatype this is a python function to take one argument. It compares and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. It uses three data types, string, boolean, and integer. Also it should include a list which returns the third item.
3. fibonacci this is a python program to include the function fizz_buzz, it should return fizz when number is divisible by 3 and buzz when number is divisible by 5. When a number is not divisible by the provided integers, it should return the number itself.
4. http this one is a code to use the API, as for my code, I inputed the url provided on the code for the program to return details of the website. I used the json extension and included the string to bring the information back as string.
5. minmaxworking you are to create an array of integers which output only the maximum and minimum number of the provided array list
6. missing_num here, you are presented with two arrays, all containing positive integers. One of the arrays will have one extra number, it should provide the missing number too.
7. prime this one should output all the prime numbers within a given range
8. wordcountworking this one should output how many times a word is displaying, should output the words themselves, and they should be split so that each word is on its own.
