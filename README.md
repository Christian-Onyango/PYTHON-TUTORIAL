1. carclass_working this one uses python to instantiate various vehicles. It also uses also inheritance and polymorphism. I included the *args used in python for method overloading because we were passing many arguments in the code.
2. datatype this is a python function to take one argument. It compares and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. It uses three data types, string, boolean, and integer. Also it should include a list which returns the third item.
